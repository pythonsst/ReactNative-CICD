This is a [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project bootstrapped with [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli). It includes a production-ready CI/CD pipeline with **EAS Build**, **EAS Submit**, and **EAS Update** (OTA) support.

---

# CI/CD — EAS Build · Submit · OTA

This project ships with full [Expo Application Services (EAS)](https://expo.dev/eas) support for building, submitting, and delivering over-the-air updates to three environments: **development**, **staging**, and **production**.

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Install EAS CLI (one-time global install)
npm install -g eas-cli

# 2. Log in and link the project to your Expo account
eas login
eas init

# 3. Set up iOS signing credentials (one-time, per Apple Developer account)
eas credentials --platform ios
# → Select: Build Credentials → All: Set up all required credentials
# → EAS generates and stores the Distribution Certificate + Provisioning Profile

# 4. Add EXPO_TOKEN to your GitHub repo secrets
#    expo.dev → Account Settings → Access Tokens → Create Token
#    GitHub → repo Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New secret → EXPO_TOKEN

# 5. You're ready — trigger a build from the Actions tab or locally:
yarn eas:dev:ios              # iOS development build
yarn eas:staging:ios          # iOS staging build
yarn eas:prod:ios             # iOS production build
yarn eas:version:check        # verify native/app version alignment before release
yarn eas:update:staging       # OTA update (JS changes only, no new build)
```

For the complete guide including setup checklist, environment table, release flow, Android flavor mapping, and troubleshooting, run:

```bash
yarn eas:help
# or open: docs/EAS.md
```

## GitHub Actions workflows

| Workflow | Trigger | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `eas-build-submit.yml` | Manual | Build + submit in one run (recommended for releases) |
| `eas-build.yml` | Manual | Build only |
| `eas-submit.yml` | Manual | Submit the latest build |
| `eas-update.yml` | Manual | Push an OTA update (no build needed) |
| `ci.yml` | Pull request | Run tests + lint on every PR |

## Environment → Android flavor mapping

| EAS profile | Android Gradle task | iOS Xcode scheme |
|---|---|---|
| `development` | `bundleDevelopmentRelease` | `IgniteKit development` |
| `staging` | `bundleStagingRelease` | `IgniteKit staging` |
| `production` | `bundleProductionRelease` | `IgniteKit production` |

**Naming:** The three environments are always **`development`**, **`staging`**, **`production`** (EAS profile = Android flavor = env file). iOS schemes are prefixed **`IgniteKit `** matching the Xcode project name; Android flavors stay short for Gradle. Same `applicationId` on Android across flavors.

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
